# The Web3 Super App

Kryptik provides a single interface for your most important online interactions. Swap, send, and save across 10+ blockchains with the Kryptik web wallet.

## About

Key pairs can do wonderful things, but existing wallets like Metamask confine their magic to a single blockchain.
The Kryptik wallet is built to break through the borders of Ethereum and streamline digital ownership across the internet. One secure wallet. One simple interface. One magical future.
