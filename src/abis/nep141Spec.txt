/************************************/
// Simple transfer to a receiver.
//
// Requirements:
// * Caller of the method must attach a deposit of 1 yoctoⓃ for security purposes
// * Caller must have greater than or equal to the `amount` being requested
//
// Arguments:
// * `receiver_id`: the valid NEAR account receiving the fungible tokens.
// * `amount`: the number of tokens to transfer, wrapped in quotes and treated
//   like a string, although the number will be stored as an unsigned integer
//   with 128 bits.
// * `memo` (optional): for use cases that may benefit from indexing or
//    providing information for a transfer.
function ft_transfer(
    receiver_id: string,
    amount: string,
    memo: string|null
): void {}

// Transfer tokens and call a method on a receiver contract. A successful
// workflow will end in a success execution outcome to the callback on the same
// contract at the method `ft_resolve_transfer`.
//
// You can think of this as being similar to attaching native NEAR tokens to a
// function call. It allows you to attach any Fungible Token in a call to a
// receiver contract.
//
// Requirements:
// * Caller of the method must attach a deposit of 1 yoctoⓃ for security
//   purposes
// * Caller must have greater than or equal to the `amount` being requested
// * The receiving contract must implement `ft_on_transfer` according to the
//   standard. If it does not, FT contract's `ft_resolve_transfer` MUST deal
//   with the resulting failed cross-contract call and roll back the transfer.
// * Contract MUST implement the behavior described in `ft_resolve_transfer`
//
// Arguments:
// * `receiver_id`: the valid NEAR account receiving the fungible tokens.
// * `amount`: the number of tokens to transfer, wrapped in quotes and treated
//   like a string, although the number will be stored as an unsigned integer
//   with 128 bits.
// * `memo` (optional): for use cases that may benefit from indexing or
//    providing information for a transfer.
// * `msg`: specifies information needed by the receiving contract in
//    order to properly handle the transfer. Can indicate both a function to
//    call and the parameters to pass to that function.

// This function is implemented on the receiving contract.
// As mentioned, the `msg` argument contains information necessary for the receiving contract to know how to process the request. This may include method names and/or arguments. 
// Returns a value, or a promise which resolves with a value. The value is the
// number of unused tokens in string form. For instance, if `amount` is 10 but only 9 are
// needed, it will return "1".
